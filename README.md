## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated and tech-savvy professional with extensive experience in providing comprehensive administrative support across diverse industries. With a passion for information security and cybersecurity, I recently completed a Certificate III in Information Technology at TAFE NSW and a Google Career Certificate in Cybersecurity.

I have demonstrated proficiency in leveraging advanced Excel capabilities for data analysis, implementing structured filing systems, and optimizing workflows through process improvements.  

Committed to continuous learning and professional growth, I have completed several cybersecurity certifications, including the Microsoft Certified Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals, and a course on Cyber Security Threat Assessment and Risk Management. I have gained specialised knowledge in areas such as identity management, secure authentication techniques, and risk mitigation strategies.

My strong work ethic, adaptability, and collaborative approach make me a valuable asset to any team. I am eager to leverage my passion for technology and dedication to ensuring the safety and integrity of IT systems in a supportive role within the IT industry.

I'm currently pursuing a Cyber Security program at TAFE NSW (Technical and Further Education, New South Wales). This educational journey is equipping me with essential skills and knowledge in the rapidly evolving field of information security.

I'm developing a web platform for padel enthusiasts. The site will allow players to:

- Create personal profiles
- Find and connect with potential playing partners
- Log match scores
- Earn points based on their performance
- Climb a ranking ladder

The ranking system will mimic professional tours like ATP or WTA, but for amateur players. This creates a competitive yet friendly environment for padel players to improve their skills and expand their network.
The ultimate goal is to foster a vibrant community of padel players, making it easier for enthusiasts to enjoy the sport, track their progress, and challenge themselves.
